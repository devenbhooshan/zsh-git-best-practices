## zsh-git-best-practices

A zsh prompt to encourage best practices of git. Currently it
encourages you to commit frequently by showing a message on the command
prompt when it sees any uncommited changes. [Here](https://devenbhooshan.wordpress.com/2020/08/08/why-should-i-commit-frequently/) is the blog post explaining why commiting frequenty is important. 

See the image below – the plugin is showing `Don’t forget to commit frequently` in the command prompt in red color.
